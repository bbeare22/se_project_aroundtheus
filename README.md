# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

1. Project 3 Around the U.S.

2. In this project I had to create an adaptive website to fit multiple screen sizes. Resolution ranging from 320px to 1280px and higher. The project brief showed a photo gallery arranged from 3 photos wide and 2 photos tall. In order to complete this project I had to use display grid with grid-template-columns: auto-fit to get the photo gallery to be adaptive to the different screen sizes. Once that challenge was complete I moved onto media queries. I used media queries at different resolutions in order to get the webpage to match the figma brief and not break the design. The first media querie I used was at 1100px to add padding to the sides of the webpage to get rid of sticky elements when the resolution size gets smaller. the next media querie was at 770px to help the profile info not get smashed together at the tablet resolution. The last media querie was used at 620px to fit small mobile devices when the photos became one column. Once that was complete then I moved onto matching the figma font/ margins.

3. I really liked working on this project. I liked working with display grid and media queries, it was challenging at first but now I feel like I have a good understanding of both. Id like to improve on the figma design by maybe adding a background image to the whole page just so its not just a black background. Something subtle obviously to not distract the user from the photo gallery. All in all it was a fun project to work on and I'm very happy with how it turned out.
